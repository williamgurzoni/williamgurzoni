# Hi there! I'm William 👋

With over a decade of experience in tech, I've had the opportunity to try my hand at a variety of roles. Right now, I'm having a blast as a Full Stack Developer, with a focus on hybrid mobile development. My diverse background has made me a pro at handling all aspects of a project, from understanding what the client needs to bringing the solution to life.
